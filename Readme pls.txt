This telegram bot uses the yocasa api, checks the subscription to the channel, and performs autopayments if the payment data has been saved by the user. It is perfect for those who want a bot that does almost everything for the administrator himself, the administrator will only have to keep the content in his closed tg channel. I do not dispute that this bot can be modified and made even better, so everything is in your hands
